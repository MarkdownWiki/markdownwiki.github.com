<p><a href='http://markdownwiki.com'>MarkdownWiki</a> allows users to create wikis in the cloud, using the markdown language instead of traditional wiki-syntax. As a markup language, <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>markdown</a> has exploded over the past few years thanks to sites such as Github that use it for parsing readme files in repositories. Even this blog post is written in markdown!</p>

<p>After immersing myself in markdown for the last few years, I went to edit a page on a personal wiki that was using MediaWiki, and felt completely lost. Over the last decade, wiki-syntax hasnt changed all that much. Popular wikis, open source and enterprise, include the likes of platforms such as MediaWiki and Atlassian&#8217;s Confluence. If you&#8217;ve ever used either, or both of these platforms, you&#8217;ll know that theyre both very different from one another. One common trait is that they both require that you host them on your own machines and require setup and configuration. For someone (or community) that wants a small wiki to host some pages, this makes things a great hassle. In the case of Confluence, they have a hosted option, but it costs upward of $50/month, and thats to start with only 10 users. For a small group of people, that could be a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id='taking_a_githublike_approach'>Taking a Github-like approach</h2>

<p>As a developer, I use Github everyday for hosting my projects and for collaborating with others on projects. It opens up a world of possibilities, allowing users to contribute to other open source (or even private, closed-source) projects.</p>

<p>When I look at whats available for popular wiki platforms I see a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>They require you to install them on your own machines and manage them.</li>

<li>They can cost a lot of money for a small number of users</li>
</ul>

<p>MarkdownWiki is here to fix that. Github has proven that its possible to provide a quality, easy to use, free service to its users, while leveraging the demand for paid private repositories to actually make money. So lets do that.</p>

<h2 id='free_wikis_for_everyone'>Free Wikis for Everyone!</h2>

<p>From the beginning, it will be free for users to signup and create wikis. You&#8217;ll be able to add users as collaborators to your wikis. The only limitation that will be in place will be a limit on the space you have for file/attachments that you can include in your wikis (dont worry, we&#8217;ll be sure to give you a decent amount of space).</p>

<h2 id='private_wikis'>Private Wikis</h2>

<p>We have to be able to make money somehow, and we know that everyone hates ads, and we&#8217;re not about to sell your private information to other companies. Instead, we&#8217;re going to offer private wikis. We havent decided on what aspect to charge for them on though. Should we could charge based on the number of wikis you want, number of collaborators, upload space, etc. We would love to hear you input though, so feel free to respond in the comments below with what you would be willing to pay for.</p>

<h2 id='stay_tuned'>Stay Tuned!</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re actively developing MarkdownWiki so that we can get it out to users, so be sure to stay tuned for updates on our progress. We&#8217;ll be updating this blog as we go with the progress we&#8217;re making, and might even look for your input on features and functionality. If youd like to receive updates, <a href='http://markdownwiki.com/register.html'>you can signup here</a>. We&#8217;ll send you things like updates and even early access and beta testing invites so that you can help us out!</p>
